0.  BMP <= 4,294,967,296, GIF <= 256 colors, JPEG <= 16,777,216 colors, PNG <= 281.5 trillion colors
1.  GIF
2.  Lossy compression approximates certain data and results in file alteration/degradation, whereas lossless yields a bit copy of the original.
3.  JPEG
4.  When a file is deleted, the first character of its name is changed to 0xe5 (meaning it is ignored by the O/S) and the pointers to subsequent sectors are deleted. Directory information is not modified.
5.  We can destroy the physical disk, use a degausser or overwrite every sector with zeroes.
6.  stdint.h is a header file which declares bit sizes (widths) for various integer types.
7.  1, 4, 4, 2
8.  0x4d42
9.  bfSize is the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file and biSize is the number of bytes required by the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure.
10. If biHeight is negative it means that the BMP is constructed from the top down.
11. biBitCount
12. 'Outfile' may be corrupt or there may be errors with permissions for example. Fopen returns NULL if the file cannot be opened, for whatever reason.
13. In fread, the arguments are as follows: (location to store result of fread function, size of element to be read, number of elements, location to read from). In this case we want 1 element the size of a BITMAPHEADER.
14. 3
15. fseek sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream by offsetting a given number of Bytes from the position specified by whence
16. FSEEK_CUR is a whence operator in fseek which sets the offset relative to the current file position indicator
17. TODO
